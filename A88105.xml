            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Preſented you with a former Booke againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Saltm.</hi> his Remora to the Reformation in hand, as I did other mine honoured and worthy friends; this I offer to your view as to Judges of the difference betwixt him and me, as it hath been a gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate by the preſſe from an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>Reply,</hi> from that to a <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> where for the preſent the period is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:130535:3"/>and for my part it ſhall be to me as an Herculean pillar, (beyond which I will not ſayle) and this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with my Reaſons I have imparted to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Saltm.</hi> in a particular Epiſtle to himſelfe. But though I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further with him in the reciprocation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, you may be pleaſed, having acquaintance with him, as he maketh his addreſſes to you, or as any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie preſenteth him before you, to contribute ſome of your diſcreet counſels for better imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his parts and pen, then in crying downe that Diſcipline and Government, as terrible and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall, which the prudent Senators of both the Honourable Houſes of Parliament in part have ſet up, and further endeavour to advance; and in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the maintenance of Miniſters as <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> and <hi>Iewiſh,</hi> which the ſame authoritie by many ancient Acts, and your ſelves with your Honourable Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats by a late Ordinance have eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>For the former, I profeſſe unto you, it is matter of wonder unto me, how any man can have the face to make ſuch out-cryes againſt the Government, as he and ſome others doe, as if it were more formidable then Prelaticall domination in the higheſt degree; when every Biſhop by his own power ſet out Articles in his Viſitation, concerning all aberrations from Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Canons, whether ſinnes or no ſinnes, and by a meere Arbitrary power made many times crimes of duties, as preaching in the afternoone of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; and duties of crimes, as Reading the Book for Recreations and ſports on that Day; and conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and cenſured all ſorts of perſons, (by his ſole Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction) ſentencing whom he would to ſuſpenſion,
<pb facs="tcp:130535:3"/>and excommunication, impoſed Orders of Penance with ordinary Fees, and extraordinary Commutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſometimes at no leſſe then 100 or 200 pound price; beſides the additionall power of Juſtice-ſhip of Peace, and the High Commiſſion, whereby the two Archbiſhops, and as many as in either Province they made choice of, to be Aſſeſſors to them on that dreadfull Tribunall puniſhed, as they thought meet, with fine and impriſonment, with great fines, and long impriſonment, many times for ſmall faults, and ſometimes for none at all; whereby ſome of them carryed their concurrent authoritie with ſuch cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that moſt were overawed by it, knowing it was great and various, and not knowing, for the moſt part, when they did act by one power, when by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>And can our Anti-presbyterian oppoſites ſay that any ſingle Presbyter, any Presbytery Parochiall, Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall, or Provinciall, aſſume any ſuch juriſdiction, or power, either over mens perſons or eſtates? Is not ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Church the utmoſt authoritie they claime? and is this any more then they that both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, and contemne the Presbytery, of their own free-will, or ſelf-will doe unto themſelves?</p>
            <p>It is ſaid by ſome, that to ſet up Presbytery in ſtead of Prelacy is to multiplie Clergie maſters over the people, and for one Biſhop in a Dioceſſe to ſet up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in ſome no fewer then a thouſand for one; But they ſhould conſider that all the Eccleſiaſticall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Dioceſſe united in one Biſhop, as in an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb facs="tcp:130535:4"/>Sea, was as the river<note n="*" place="margin">Cyrus Gynden late fuſum amnem vado tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire tentavit: ibt unus ex equis qui trahere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium currum albi ſolcbant, abreptus, vehementer commovit regem. Juravit itaque amnem illum regiis equis meatum aufereutem, co ſe redactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ut tranſiri, calcarique etiam a foeminis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.

               <hi>Gyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> very deepe, and of a boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtreame, as when it drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the white Horſe that drew the Charet of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but being divided among ſo many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or Presbyters, it is as the ſame River, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the loſſe, and meaning to be revenged of it, cauſed it to be divided into three hundred and ſixtie channels.</p>
            <p>And yet is not every Presbyter (though a Biſhop) as a Prelate in his own Pariſh, that is, endowed with ſole power of cenſures, for others are to be joyned in adminiſtration of Government with him, in many places many for one, and in no place under a double number.</p>
            <p>As for the right of Presbytery, whether it be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or humane, I conceive, if the Queſtion were rightly ſtated, and the officers their power, dutie, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications? and adminiſtrations clearly diſtinguiſhed, thoſe that are in extremes for their Tenets, whether holding all of it, or none of it to be of Divine right, would be eafily convinced of an errour, and a Tenure would be found out, and made good, wherein Chriſt might have his due to the full, without any diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Magiſtrates juſt Authoritie, or of any liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which truly might be called Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>For the latter concerning the unlawfulneſſe of Tythes, if his Tenet now be right, his taking of them before was wrong; and the ſame conſtitution
<pb facs="tcp:130535:4"/>of conſcience, which makes him now to renounce them, may make him at leaſt to doubt whether he be not bound to returne what he hath received of the Pariſhioners of <hi>Braſteed</hi> in that kinde into their hands againe, by vertue of that received Rule of<note n="*" place="margin">Non remitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur peccatum ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi reſtituatur ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum. <hi>Auguſt.

            <p>And if he appeare before you againe, you may doe well to put ſuch a caſe of conſcience to his conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For my part I am ſorry to ſee him ſo unſetled in his judgement, ſo ſedulous in his endeavours (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Evangelicall calmeneſſe, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and moderation of ſpirit) to prepare a Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage for all wild and wicked fancies, that every man may beleeve what he liſt, and live as he beleeveth, and ſo may doe what is right in his own eyes, that is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is wrong in the eyes of God and of all good men, as if there were no King in Iſrael, <hi>Iudges</hi> 17.6. that is, no Government (for then the Kingly power over that people was not ſet up.)</p>
            <p>But the cure of this belongs to the care of your ſelves, and your Honourable Colleagues, for whom it is our parts, whom God hath placed under your power and protection, unceſſantly to ſupplicate to the throne of Grace, that as you have pulled down the remainders, and removed the rubbiſh of ruined Babel from among us, ſo you may in Gods good time (and the ſooner the better) ſet up in ſtead thereof ſuch a faire, and goodly frame of Church-government, from the foundation to the top-ſtone, as may be entertained with ſhouting, not of a party onely, as at the laying of

            <p>And for mine owne part, I will deale clearely with you, and let you know my mind, not onely for the preſent, but for the future; and it is this. <hi>For the preſent,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doe not take you to be ſuch an adverſary as may diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a man, though but of meane parts, (if not with all of too puſillanimous a ſpirit) to be your Antagoniſt; ſince you lay your ſelfe open to ſo much diſadvantage, as may rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him to begin with you, then diſhearten him to hold on when you provoke him to proceed.</p>
            <p>But yet (beſides the diſſwaſions of my judicious friends, who thinke I may right my ſelfe as much by a ſilent neglect of you as by a loud conqueſt over you) I will give my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and my reaſons.</p>

            <p>Firſt, becauſe I ſee your genius is rather <hi>Rhetoricall,</hi> or <hi>Poëticall,</hi> then <hi>Polemicall;</hi> and will not keepe cloſe to a queſtion to bring it to an iſſue; and ſo you ſcatter your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions like drops of quickſilver out of the quill; or like beads broke looſe from the ſtring, ſo that it is matter of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and ſometimes rather of impoſsibility, to gather them into an argument, ſince they have more in them of the complexion and trappings of Phraſiologie, then of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of ſound Divinity; which makes me (beſides that I had rather contend with an Antichriſtian Adverſary then with a Chriſtian Brother) more willing to take the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the moſt learned part of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for my taske, then to wait upon your wandring and new ſprung notions, though now and then you preſent your Reader with a Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe

            <p>But this onely <hi>obiter,</hi> paſsing by him, and his booke, (as a parentheſis or parergon to that which is before me at the preſent) I muſt follow you a little further, and ſee whether (tracing the ſteps of your opinions by the print of your pen) I can overtake you, and at laſt find you in any place, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of conſiſtence, or ſettlement.</p>
            <p>In your <hi>Diſcovery of Independencie</hi> you deliver down-right Anabaptiſme in many particulars, (without any word of exception or caution to your Reader) as that<note n="h" place="margin">Smoke p. 10, 11.</note>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That childrens Baptiſme in the Church is a way never to have a Church of ſuch baptized beleevers, as in the Apoſtles times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Baptiſme, being a viſible ſigne, cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be adminiſtred upon one that can neither ſee, nor diſcerne what is done, to whom the water can be no ſigne, but they are onely told of it when they come to age. Baptiſme is as a flaſh of lightning, (as was well obſerved by one) Circumciſion was as a fixed ſtarre, ſo much difference in theſe two rites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſtitution of Baptiſme is to duty as well as grace, which children cannot performe, and ſo anſwer the ſigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſtitution of Baptiſme is doctrinal in the very act of it, as is acknowledged by all of the preſent Baptiſme,</hi> Matth. <hi>28. now this implyes a capable and teachable ſubject.</hi> You have other poſitions ſymbolizing with the ſect of Anabaptiſts, but I note onely thoſe, which have neereſt congruitie to the title of that Sect.</p>
            <p>While ſuch opinions as theſe, which you ſeeme rather to confirme then to confute, incline me to take you for an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt, I am induced to doubt whether you be not ſomewhat elſe, ſomewhat worſe, by ſuch exceptions as<note n="i" place="margin">Smoke in the Temple. p. 13, 14, 15.</note> theſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Baptiſme of Ieſus Chriſt by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was onely in the Name of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>That the forme by which they Baptize</hi> (viz. <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:130535:10"/>of man, a meere conſequence drawne from ſuppoſition, and probabilitie, and not a forme left by Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That to preach in the Name of Ieſus Chriſt, or to do any thing in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, is not alwaies in that groſſe manner (as it is taken)</hi> viz. <hi>naming Ieſus Chriſt, or the naming of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt over them, but in the power, vertue, efficacie, Miniſterie of Ieſus Chriſt, or the Perſons of the Godhead, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Sixthly,<note n="l" place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> 
               <hi>That the fulneſſe of time is not yet come for ordinances, for as there were ſeverall ſeaſons for giving out of truth before, ſo now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Title (under which you ſort the opinions of theſe times into ſeverall profeſsions) is of <hi>ſeeking and ſeekers,</hi> and there, (beſides other new Doctrines which you deliver) you ſay that<note n="m" place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> 
               <hi>all ſhall in the laſt times be in a ſecret, inviſible inward and ſpirituall glory, no more in groſſe, carnall, viſible evidences, &amp; materiall beames of gifts, &amp; miracles, &amp; this is to know Chriſt no more after the fleſh;</hi> which cannot be the meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words, <hi>2 Cor. 5.16.</hi> (for gifts and miracles continued after the time that he wrote thoſe words) but either that he did not conceive of Chriſt as of a temporall King, as the Diſciples ſometimes did, <hi>Luk. 24.21. Act. 1.6.</hi> and our Saviour himſelfe denyed, <hi>Joh. 18.36.</hi> or that his affections to Chriſt were not ſuch as theirs that had converſed with him in the fleſh, and had been taken onely, or chiefly with the comeltneſſe of his perſon, or had the ſenſible evidence of his miracles, or had a carnall conviction of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as <hi>Thomas Didymus</hi> had, <hi>Joh. 20.27.</hi> but that he did ſpiritually participate and communicate with him, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:130535:10"/>life and vertue from him, as the members from the head, as where he ſaith, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me, and the life which I now live, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God, who loved me, and gave himſelfe for me,</hi> Gal. <hi>2.20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another poſition (which you give out among the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the way of <hi>Seekers,</hi> which to orthodox Divines is a meere paradox) is,<note n="n" place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> that <hi>there is no ſuch power for ordinances as is pretended, but beleevers as diſciples may adminiſter, and ſo did the Apoſtles and beleevers formerly as they were diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I looked to have. found the Antinomian Tenets among the reſt which you report, but your ſilence concerning them in a place whereto their diſcovery was ſo ſeaſonable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, is thought by ſome, who have read over your booke of <hi>Free Grace</hi> before I ſaw it, that you thought too honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of that Sect to bring it in there, where you intended to ſet<note n="o" place="margin">Pag. 19.</note>

               </note> words with a guilefull reſervation, breaking them off with a ſubtle, &amp;c. whereas if you had gone on to thoſe that follow next, you would have ſhewed the Reader a flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Cardinall Tenet of the Antinomians,

               </note> malicious Papiſt uſed againſt <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> when he brought him in, ſaying, <hi>I would the names of the Trinitie, Perſon, homoouſios, &amp;c.</hi> were buryed, but left out theſe words; <hi>So that the truth of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Creed were received and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by all;</hi> we ſay the Papiſt in this corrupt and maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed allegation followed the devill in his quotation of the <hi>91</hi> Pſalme againſt our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 4.6.</hi> where he bringeth in a Text of divine Providence, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, and in their hands they ſhall beare thee up, left at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone, verſ. 11, 12.</hi> but leaveth out the limitation, they ſhall <hi>keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi>

            <p>And I would take you for an Antinomian (as many doe) but that in the ſame booke whence they have learned to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you for one of that Sect, I finde ſomewhat which ſhews you are not ſetled in their way, and it is your equall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different dealing in part betwixt the Antinomians and their oppoſites in theſe words;<note n="t" place="margin">Occaſionall word <hi>prefixed before the</hi> flowings of Chriſts blood. <hi>pag. 1, 2.</hi>

            <p>All this while having endeavoured to diſcover of what Religion you are, I cannot yet finde that you have made choice of any.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this third reaſon of my refuſall to take you for an Antagoniſt hereafter, if I have been too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, it is becauſe you have been too various and diffuſive in your fancies for matters of religion, ſo that I ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I know not where to finde any certaine fixing of your faith, nor in what predicament of profeſsion to place you, whether directly or reductively.

               <hi>For ſome things in my Booke of Policie I looke on them as a part of the darkneſſe I was in, and I can freely joyne with any in cenſuring my unregenerate part in me, as I eſteeme much of my carnall reaſon to be.</hi>

               <hi>I told you my Politicks were written by my dimmer light;</hi> and yet let me tell you Sir (and I beleeve all judicious Readers of your Dictates will be of my minde) that booke was the beſt that ever you wrote, and therefore the beſt becauſe freeſt from errour, and freeſt from errour, becauſe it ſetteth down the <hi>practice of Policie in a Chriſtian life, taught from the Scriptures,</hi> as you expreſſe it in your Title Page, and conſiſteth of apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes, grounded upon a Text of Gods word, for the moſt part pertinently and truly applyed.</p>
            <p>A fifth Reaſon why I ſhall but this once, not hereafter take you to taske in a word warre, is this; I perceive you glory in the quicke diſpatch of your worke, that is, to mine underſtanding, in beſtowing little ſtudy and taking little paines for what you publiſh, or, (as the Proverbe hath it) <hi>in making more haſte then good ſpeed.</hi> For in your Letter to me you ſay thus;<note n="g" place="margin">Smoke, p. 2.</note> 
               <hi>You ſee my labours, deducting the time of their printing, are of about two weekes growth, younger by ſome ſixe weekes if I miſtake not then yours;</hi> where you meane not I ſuppoſe that I was ſixe weekes in anſwering a ſheet of paper of yours, and that you anſwered fifteene ſheets of mine in two weekes; for you know not what private time I tooke for it out of publique employment; but comparing the publication of my booke from the Preſſe about the tenth of December, and of yours about the ſixteenth of Ianuary following, the computation you make in that reſpect is not much miſtaken: But why Sir ſhould you confine your ſelfe to two weekes time, when it was in your power to have allowed your ſelfe more? and it ſhould have been a part of your prudence not to have tuckt your ſelfe up to ſo little, eſpecially if you conceive, (as you ſay in
<pb facs="tcp:130535:13"/>your Letter to me,) <hi>I have much advantage of learning and experience;</hi> Sure if you thought ſo indeed, you would be more wiſe then to give me ſo much advantage by your over-haſty, and unconcocted effuſions, as you have done; Nor is this the firſt time of your precipitation and boaſting in this kinde, for in the yeere <hi>1643.</hi> you ſet forth an <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Fullers Faſt Sermon,</hi> (preached at the Savoy, <hi>Iuly 26.</hi> and afterward printed), and you dedicated your Booke to thoſe Divines (under the Title of <hi>The moſt Sacred and Reverend Aſſembly for Reformation of the Church convened by Parliament</hi>) whom now you mention with a <hi>meioſis</hi> of eſtimation, as if all of them together were but a companie of ſuch deſpicable dwarfes, that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. T.</hi> the confident Antipaedobaptiſt might defie them, as <hi>Goliah</hi> did all the armie of Iſrael; and in the firſt lines of your Epiſtle Dedicatorie to them, you ſay <hi>you have but the thoughts of an afternoone to ſpread before them, and that you examined in the ſame pace you read.</hi> Now truly Sir, if this be true, I cannot commend your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in ſuch expedition; I know you will not plead for your warrant the words of our Saviour to <hi>Judas, Joh. 13.27.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You pretend as the motive to ſuch haſty motion, that your intent was, if it <hi>were poſſible, truth might overtake an errour before it went too farre, and you hope for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don if your zeale to the truth made you ſee anothers faults ſooner then your owne;</hi> but you ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that your adverſary was a man of eminent parts, much more adviſed in what he publiſhed in the Pulpit, and by the Preſſe, then your ſelfe; and that following him in ſuch poſt-haſt, before you had well weighed what you wrote againſt him, it was not like to fall out, that (at long running) truth ſhould overtake errour, but rather that many errours on your part ſhould overtake ſome errours on his; and that
<pb facs="tcp:130535:13"/>the <hi>zeale which made you ſee anothers faults ſooner then your own</hi> was too like that of the hypocrite, <hi>Mat. 7. verſ. 3, 4, 5.</hi> and not to be thought more capable of pardon then of reproofe; for the truth had no ſtead of, nor was it like to have any aid by ſuch an extemporary undertaking of a cauſe of ſo great moment as the reformation of the Church.</p>

               <p>For that of the Apoſtle, <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne,</hi> Rom. 14.23. it imports (as ſome expound it) that all the workes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels are ſinnes, that it belongeth alſo to beleevers, and boundeth them ſo in their Chriſtian practice, that they muſt doe nothing againſt conſcience, nothing with a doubting conſcience, nothing at all which hath not warrant from the Word either in generall principles, or particular concluſions; and it ſerves likewiſe to ſhut out meere humane inventions from the worſhip of God, and the luxuriant fruitfulneſſe of humane fancie, againſt which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Orthodoxe<note n="a" place="margin">Tert. deprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. adverſ. haeret.

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe ſubordinate gatherings are not made out of any conceipt favouring of ſingularitie, diſdaine, or contempt of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire communion with thoſe out of whom they are gathered, as in your gatherings of Churches, but out of care and compaſſion to them to conſult and provide for their good, as the gathering of the principall Patriots out of the countrey to be united in the Houſe of Commons, is not for making of a Schiſme from their countrey, but for meeting in counſell and care for their countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This gathering into Claſſes, &amp;c. is with conſent and free choice of thoſe Societies out of which they are gathered, as it is in the choice of Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: not ſo in your Church gatherings, for thoſe who are left out, when you admit of Members in your ſelected choice for Church-way, are diſpleaſed with your neglects of them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall to adminiſter all the ordinances of God unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thoſe who you call out as Members of your new ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Churches, might more conveniently joyne together in the adminiſtration of holy things, as they are by Gods providence diſpoſed of in Pariſhionall dwellings, then your covenanted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who are many times in their habitations as farre diſtant as <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> yea, ſometimes as farre as <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, Raterdam, Arnhem,</hi> or <hi>New England:</hi> But the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:130535:22"/>of Paſtours and Elders into Claſſicall Aſſemblies, is made with much conveniency, and withall in a kinde of neceſſitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Churches whom they repreſent cannot poſſibly all of them convene in one place, or if they could, they would be too many to be drawn from their dwellings, too many to be admitted to counſell and cenſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Gatherings of Miniſters and Elders into Claſſes, &amp;c. makes much for preſervation of truth and peace in Parochiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, but your gatherings of Churches are, and have proved the meanes to broach e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The gathering of Elders for conſultation and proviſion for the welfare of other particular Churches, as it hath ſure ground of religious reaſon, ſo hath it the honour of moſt ancient and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable preſcription from the<note n="*" place="margin">Bin.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The gathering of Miniſters and Elders into Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies Claſſicall, &amp;c. is authorized by the Parliament, the ſupreame Iudicatory of the Kingdome, whereas your Church gathering is not allowed by authoritie, but taken up without it, and againſt it.</p>

                  </note> ſome learned men have reſolved <hi>that viſions are not more excellent then dreames,</hi> and the reaſons may be; Firſt, becauſe in Scripture they are brought in as Revelations, though different, yet without prelation of the one before the other, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. <hi>If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my ſelfe known unto him in a viſion, and ſpeake unto him in a dreame,</hi> Num. 12.6.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:130535:29"/>Secondly, as great matters are repreſented in dreames as in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the affliction of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their deliverance was revealed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in a dreame, Gen. 15.12. and the intercourſe betwixt heaven and earth, in the miniſtery of Angels was repreſented to <hi>Jacob</hi> in a dreame, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. It was in a dreame that <hi>Solomon</hi> had the ſingular wiſdome imparted to him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.5. By a dreame was the conception of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt revealed to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Matth. 1.20. and the plot of perdition againſt him, with the way to prevent it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as for the matter, ſo for the manner, Revelation by a dreame is as cleare, and as ſure as by a viſion; as in that of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> of <hi>Iacob,</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> forementioned; to which we may adde that of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 20.3. and out of humane Authours; the dreame of<note n="h" place="margin">Hieron.

               <p>But we may ſay further that <hi>dreames</hi> have an excellency above <hi>viſions,</hi> and the reaſon is this: That which hath more of God, and leſſe of man, is more excellent then that which contrariwiſe hath more of man and leſſe of God: now in dreames there is more of God, and leſſe of man; becauſe in ſleepe the ſenſes are bound up, and ſo there is more communion betwixt the ſpirit of God, and the ſoule of man, and leſſe interruption in that communion then to men awake; ſo that in dreames there is no diſturbing of the Revelation by the concurrence of ſenſuall objects, no denying or ſuſpending of aſſent by examination of reaſon, as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.<note n="k" place="margin">Rivet. ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note>

               <p>The ſecond Particular which your comparative ſpeech imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is, <hi>that viſions aſcribed to young men are denied to old men;</hi> whereas old men have their viſions as well as young; as <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt though he were young when he came firſt to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple of his and our great Maſter, had his Revelations by viſion in the Iſle of <hi>Pathmus</hi> when he was old, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 96. yeer of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which muſt be at leaſt the 80. yeere of <hi>Johns</hi> age, if we ſuppoſe him to be but 14. yeeres old at the entrance of his attendance on him, and younger we cannot reaſonably imagine him to have been at that time.</p>
               <p>A third thing which <hi>in your compariſon of young men and old for viſions and dreames.</hi> I may not admit of, is, that <hi>you bring it to the matter of reformation, and make it as if the young men had ſeent a viſion, and that old men had but ſome darke notions of it, like unto a nightly dreame;</hi> which is ſo preſumptuous and groundleſſe a conceit that your moſt waking thoughts cannot make it ſeeme otherwiſe to any ſound underſtanding, then a vapour of a young mans bragge, or the vanity of a ſick mans dreame.</p>

And for that you ſay, <hi>certainly you intend a terrible Government,</hi> though you ſpeake to me, you doe not meane it of me, for you have ſaid<note n="*" place="margin">Smoke, p. 23.</note> before, <hi>What if ſuch as your ſelfe, and ſome other godly meeke of your way propound nothing but wayes of meekneſſe to your ſelves, can you undertake, &amp;c.</hi> whereby you ſeeme to acquit me from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of ſuch rigour as you ſuſpect in others; and if that be your meaning, you are not miſtaken in my ſpirit, for if I know any thing of it, it is farre from that height of heat againſt any oppoſers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever which was in the Diſciples of our Saviour againſt the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> when they received him not, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.54.</p>
               <p>And I confeſſe, in the preſence of God who knoweth the hearts of all men, that if a ſpirit of meekneſſe, and ſweetneſſe, and of all affectionate and faire inſinuations would prevaile with the moſt perverſe and blaſphemous heretique to winne him to be cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſts, I could wiſh the golden Scepter held out to invite him into the communion of the Church, rather then the iron rod to bruiſe, or breake, or to affright him from the Church. And though you meane this of others, who ſhew themſelves Zealots for the Presbyteriall Government, you are too inconſiderate, too uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, too confident in your charge; for how can you be ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as you make your ſelfe, when the thing they move for hath no terrour in it; It is true, that according to the French Proverbe, <hi>He that would have his neighbours dog hang'd gives out that he is mad;</hi> ſo your party that would have the Presbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment literally ſuſpended, and made away as a mad dog, as if it would (as <hi>Paul</hi> was before his converſion) be mad againſt the

For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> that which is ſo much ſtuck at as an incroachment upon Chriſtian liberty, and a meanes of the Miniſters domineering over the people, the ſuſpenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, are not the <hi>Independents</hi> more rigid then the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> are? for they generally ſuſpend whole Pariſhes from the Sacrament (except ſome few of their covenanted diſciples) for divers yeers together, without any law or rule at all; the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally doe not ſo; or if ſome doe forbeare communions for a time, it is not upon ſuch principles as the <hi>Independents</hi> maintaine; and they doe all they can to expedite the removall of all ſcandals from the Sacrament, wherein the <hi>Independents</hi> refuſe to joyne with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Independents</hi> deny not onely the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as hath been ſaid, but they deny the Sacrament of Baptiſme to all ſuch as are not the children of their covenanted members; the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> accept of them for a federall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe profeſſed by their parents; and if there were no more but theſe two differences betwixt them, it were enough (if men would not give up themſelves to be groſly befooled by flattery and calumny) to cry out upon the <hi>Independents</hi> for their injurious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions upon Chriſtian libertie, and to love the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> for their mildneſſe and charitie in theſe particulars: but further,</p>

                  </note> obſerved, <hi>Though the ſmalleſt of all the ſects of the time for their number, yet the greateſt for worth of their followers,</hi> yet that in a true Chriſtian conſideration makes rather againſt it; for by getting ſo many rich and great men unto their partie, and ayming ſo much at ſuch diſciples (with ſuch neglect of others as is obſerved) ſhewes that they are not minded as the Apoſtle was, when he ſaid to the Corinthians; <hi>I ſeeke not yours but you,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. but rather contrariwiſe; ſo that if they would ſay, what many by their actions ſpeake, they ſhould tell their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts; <hi>I ſeeke not you but yours,</hi> or <hi>rather yours then you.</hi> And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when rich and great men embrace Independency, it may give great cauſe of ſuſpition that they doe it, becauſe, as rich, they are apt to be high-minded, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. and all high-minded men are the moſt legitimate ſonnes of lapſed <hi>Adam,</hi> who would be Independent upon God, and be a God of himſelfe, and ſo they are apt to take up Independency, rather out of an humour of pride, then out of conſcience towards either pictie, or truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is apparent to all how ambitious many Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are of all places of honour, of power, and profit, of being Members in the Parliament, prime Officers in the Armie, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee men; and if any croſſe them, what wayes they finde out to be meet with them, ſending them tickets, and calling them in queſtion, when they know there is no juſt cauſe of exception
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:130535:35"/>againſt them, of purpoſe to caſt an awe upon all men, as if the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the State were at their ſervice, to ſecure their credits againſt all complaints how juſt ſo ever, and to diſcountenance thoſe who in an ingenuous and generous ſpirit oppoſe their uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, which are now ſo viſible to the view of all that are not wilfully blind, that it is matter of great wonder, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians (who are more in number, and dignitie, then any ſect whatſoever, and if they were as active as they, might much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top them in power) are ſo dull and indulgent towards them, as to ſuffer them ſtill to carry on their deſigne as they doe; which in ſome Presbyterians for the time paſt may be imputed to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and meekneſſe of minde, being loth to offend ſuch; but if it ſhould be ſo generall hereafter as it hath been, it might be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to a negligence, and coldneſſe in that cauſe which they ſhould endeavour to promote with all their might in all warrantable wayes of zeale, of induſtry, circumſpection, and prudence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Though you aſſigne the iron Scepter to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the golden to your Churches, the truth is, if the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents were once as Independent as they would be, they would be Maſters of both metals, both gold and iron; and ſome of their party bragge they have both the purſe and the ſword in their power; if ſo, (and in ſuch a degree as they would have it, but it is true but in part, though too much) they that now renounce appeales to Claſſicall, Provinciall, and Nationall Aſſemblies, would appeale to the ſword, and then they would be ready to ruine thoſe that would not be ruled by them, to breake thoſe that would not bow unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> You cannot finde any thing in the Presbyterians prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, nor in their practice, as they are Presbyterians, which may be matter, I ſay not of conviction, but of ſuſpition of ſuch a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible government, as you take upon you, with ſo much confidence, to charge upon them.</p>

               <p>To which I anſwer: Firſt, that my words, Sect. 9. p. 26. are theſe; <hi>It hath been, if not the fault, yet the ill hap of our Church and State, to have the Government fluttering upon the limetwig of deliberation at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>when it ſhould be upon the wing of actuall execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all over the Kingdome.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:130535:38"/>there is no reaſon that for my fault the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhould be involved in the imputation of an offence; ſince I did not write by any either command from them, or conſultation with them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, confining the charge to my ſelfe, I may challenge you for a fayling in charity, and memorie. Firſt, <hi>in charitie,</hi> in that you make ſo ill a conſtruction of my words both <hi>really,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally; really</hi> interpreting the limetwig in a ſence of defilement, whereas I meant it onely as a let and impediment; (which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the deliberations of the beſt and wiſeſt men) and <hi>perſonally,</hi> in turning the terme upon the State or Parliament, in an offenſive ſignification towards them, whom I never meant, nor mentioned with a thought or expreſſion of diſparagement. Secondly, in <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> in that you forgate a precedent paſſage in my Booke, which might (had you remembred it) have prevented ſuch a ſiniſter ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the metaphor I uſed; my words which manifeſtly hold out a confutation of your corrupt gloſſe on theſe now in queſtion, are theſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet they cannot make that ſpeed with the Government which by moſt is deſired, and very much deſired by themſelves (as we of the Aſſembly can witneſſe who have often beene ſent to by that Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Senate to quicken our worke, and to ripen our debates to a full reſolution) becauſe as with us the libertie of ſpeaking (wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one is frce to propoſe and proſecute any doubt) prolonged the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in our hands; ſo the like libertie in the Honourable Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (or rather our libertie is like theirs, it being the prototypon) longthens the debates, and delayes the votes of that moſt Honourable Senate; and ſo much the more, becauſe they are more in number then we in our Synod, and becauſe their determinations are finall as ours are not.</hi>

               <p>Secondly. In your <hi>deſigne for Pence,</hi> (as farre as you dare) you project a way to decline the Magiſtrates Authoritie about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters, which an adviſed Reader may perceive, though your termes be very cunningly choſen, and covertly couched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, where you ſay,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Smoke. p. 4. nu. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Let not aboſe beleevers who have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Magiſtrate, ſtriue to make any unwarrantable uſe of it one againſt another, becauſe Scripture principles are not ſo cleare for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, you for your part caſt a notorious calumnie upon the Parliament; calling<note n="t" place="margin">Ibid. p. 25.</note>

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:130535:39"/>
               <p>Fourthly, you give up the Magiſtrates Authoritie to the peoples libertie, leaving it in their choice to receive, or refuſe Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as they like or diſlike it; for thus you would have it propounded unto them,<note n="u" place="margin">Smoke. p. 14.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then the Doctrine of the Goſpel, condemned as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſupercilious and ſecular wiſe men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo wiſe and powerfull as it was, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 19, 20. of the ſame Chapter; nor,</p>

               <p>And was it not in his own choice to make his own pace for the proceeding both of Goſpel and Government? If you will ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Chriſt to your wayes of working, you make him Dependent, while you claime an Independent priviledge to your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And for that you ſay, <hi>for practice or precept, to order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us in what we obey,</hi> we have both in the <hi>Goſpels</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the Apoſtles, and the Hiſtory of their <hi>Acts,</hi> (according to which the Aſſembly have given up their advice to the Parliament) warrant for Church Government, and ſo we hope it will come down from them by a Parliamentary approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſtitution for the eſtabliſhment thereof throughout the whole Kingdome. And yet is not the Presbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more ambitious, or domineering then the Independent; Nay, let the Indifferent Reader obſerve, and conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and let him then reſolve, whether the Presbyterian or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent be more affected to preeminence, or more willing to come under rule and government.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Presbyterians carneſtly deſire the union, whereto
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:130535:45"/>the Apoſtle emphatically exhorteth the Chriſtian <hi>Corinthians;</hi> Now <hi>I beſeech you brethren, by the Name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeake the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you, but that ye be perfectly ioyned together in the ſame minde and in the ſame iudgement,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This union cannot be without a rule of conſent; the rule of conſent cannot be of any force, unleſſe it have the power and obligation of a law; this law requireth, as well ſubordination, as union; and this ſubordination is agreeable not onely to reaſon, but to Religion and Scripture, for <hi>the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubiect to the Prophets,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.32.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Presbyterians, who yeeld to this ſubordination, eſpecially to the Superiour Aſſemblies, not knowing, and the moſt of them not expecting to be members either of Provinciall, or Nationall Aſſemblies, doe all of them in their allowance of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall appeales ſubmit themſelves to the conſures of others, which is an act not of dominion, but of ſubjection. But the Independents will be as diffuſive in their Church-way, and grow on from Cities to Countries, from Countries to Kingdomes, and will be like lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Kings, or Free States in their own Congregations, and will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no ſubordination, or ſubmiſſion to any Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly whatſoever, though there be many caſes which reach, beyond the limits of their covenanted meetings, to occaſions of common concernment to many Churches; yea ſome of them are ſo comprehenſive, as to belong to all the Churches of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which can neither be ſufficiently conſidered, nor ordered for the generall good, without a more generall convention and conſultation of Church governours.</p>
               <p>The Pope, though hated and ſcorned by you as an Antichriſtian <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> is a great, and I may ſay the ſupreme Independent in the Chriſtian world; and his Independencie conſiſteth in this, that he will be judged of none; and herein truly S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. you ſymbolize too much with the Papall ambition; in that as much as you can you free your ſelves from all Eccleſiaſticall ſubjection; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a chief part of his Antichriſtian exaltation, Independencie is rather Antichriſtian, then Presbyterie.</p>
               <p>There is another part of the Papall pride, which is to require
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:130535:46"/>that all be ſubject unto him that he may cenſure and judge of all; and if I ſhould ſtraine your words, as you ſometimes doe mine.

               <p>Before I bring in my Reply to your Anſwer, I muſt minde you of a miſtake in your ſingle ſheet; which though it be but ſhort is lyable to a very juſt exception for an errour in Story; and you ſhould have heard of it ſooner from me, but that I obſerved it not my ſelfe untill I found I was miſguided by your allegation; for I tooke it upon truſt from you, becauſe I did not ſuſpect you would miſalledge any thing, which did no way conduce unto your cauſe, as the time of the building of the Temple doth not; now though the errour were originally yours, the correction may be mine, which you may better receive from me, then I might take miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from you; you ſay the Temple was built in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, but the truth is it was not, as you affirme, built in, but before <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, for the foundation of it was laide in the ſecond yeare of <hi>Darius,</hi> Hag. 2.10.17. <hi>(i.)</hi> in the yeere of the world 3452. 519 yeers before the Incarnation of Chriſt; and it was finiſhed in the ſixth yeere of <hi>Darius,</hi> Ezra 6.15. that is, in the yeare of the world 3456. 515 yeers before Chriſts Incarnation; but that building of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was the building of the wals of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Nehem. 2.17, 18, 19. and this was in the yeere of the world, 3527. about 444. yeeres before the birth of the Meſſias; this worke about the wals was a worke but of 52. dayes, <hi>Nehem,</hi> 6.15. the former about the Temple laſted about 4. yeeres, as from the Scriptures forealledged may be inferred.</p>
               <p>Now for your Anſwer it is this, <hi>Yea but the materiall patterne was more clearely left, and knowne then the Gospel patternes, the other were more in the letter, and theſe more in the ſpirit; now there muſt be a proving of all things, elſe there may be more haſte then good ſpeed, as the Temple may be built by a falſe patterne as well as by a true; and then better no building then no right Cedar to build withall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is all for which you challenge my ſilence; and whereas you intimate ſome ſoliditie in it, which I was not ſo well able to deale with, as with the other part of your Anſwer: Truly S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:130535:47"/>I neither had, nor have any ſuch opinion of it; it ſeemed to me at firſt, and it doth ſo now upon the review, to be an intricate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and confuſed jumbling of Metaphoricall, and literall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions together; and not more darke for lack of light, then weake for want of ſtrength to that purpoſe for which it was framed: and therefore I thought it more fit for a tacit preterition, then for an expreſſe examination. But if you will have this rather, you ſhall have it; and ſo I ſay unto it,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that if the patterne were more cleare for building the Temple, then the Goſpel patterne for the ſetting up of a Church-Government, why are you ſo confident, and peremptory, and punctuall for your Goſpel patterne?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why tell you us of Goſpel patterns in the plurall number? is there any more then one patterne of Government in the Goſpel? if ſo, though the Independent patterne be yeelded to be a Goſpel patterne, (which cannot be proved) the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian may be ſo too, for if there be more then one, that rather then any other may be allowed to be another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when you ſay the other were more in the letter, theſe more in the ſpirit, what is your meaning by theſe words? were there more formes and patternes of the Temple then one? if there were, why doe you not ſpeake more clearely to the point of difference, betwixt them? if not, why ſay you <hi>they were more in the letter?</hi> and when you ſay theſe Goſpel patterns are more in the ſpirit; I would know whether they be written, or not written; if they be written, they are as much in the letter as the other; if they be not written, how can you tell they be Goſpel patterns?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas you ſay, <hi>The Temple may be builded by a falſe patterne,</hi> if you meane it of the materiall Temple, you deny the cleareneſſe of the patterne which before you profeſſed. And,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, When you ſay, <hi>The Temple may be builded by a falſe pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, as well as by a true,</hi> if you meane it of the materiall Temple in <hi>Ezra's</hi> time, what is that to the Goſpel Government, in, or ſince our Saviours time? or if any thing, it is to contradict your ſelfe, who make the Temple patterne ſo cleare that there is no danger of a falſe patterne of miſguidance. If you meane it of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:130535:47"/>Government of the Goſpel, why doe you ſo confound what in the beginning of your Anſwer to the Objection you pretend to diſtinguiſh, to wit, the materiall Temple and the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call order of the Church?</p>

                  </note>
                  <hi>This Independency of Churches may be taken two wayes; either as not having respect to any neighbour Churches, or as not depending on the authoritie of ſome Churches, that are ioyned in ſome Claſses,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:130535:63"/>or Synod, of which the Churches themſelves may make a part; The former way is found to be more like the practiſe, cuſtome, and uſe of the Primitive Church, whereby this voluntary communion was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Churches. The latter way doth more agree with the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution which afterwards was introduced by a humane authoritie. By this latter way the libertie of particular Churches ſeemes to be leſſe</hi> (more, you ſhould ſay) <hi>diminiſhed then by the former. But that which from the beginning was arbitrary, afterwards is made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry [as a law.] This law truly is poſitive, and Eccleſiaſticall, and humane, not divine. 'Tis by a divine law that the Church of Chriſt ſhould be one, but the unitie of it doth not conſiſt in the union [or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection] of many that are of the ſame flocke or body, but in the unanimous conſent, agreement in faith and doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſaying of <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> you have not a word againſt the lawfulneſſe of the ſubordination of Churches in the Presbyteriall Government; and that which ſounds in favour of Independency, is but this;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the States of Churches by themſelves, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, or relation to any neighbour Churches, are more like the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, cuſtome, and uſe of the Primitive Church, where a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary communion was among the Churches.</hi> He doth not ſay our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did inſtitute that Government, nor that the Apoſtles gave any order for it, nor that it was the ſame that was in the Primitive Church, but that it was like the practiſe, cuſtome, and uſe of the Primitive Church.</p>
               <p>And ſo we ſay of <hi>Baptizing in rivers,</hi> of <hi>receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at night,</hi> of the <hi>love feaſts, greetings with an holy kiſſe, and communitie of goods,</hi> and many other particulars; but it will not follow that in our time, and State it is better to <hi>Baptize in rivers</hi> then in Churches, to <hi>receive the Sacrament at night</hi> then in the morning, and to continue thoſe <hi>love feaſts, and kiſſes of love,</hi> which for the abuſe of them were left off by the religious many hundred yeares agoe; nor that <hi>communitie of goods</hi> is better then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of them, as in the preſent age.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He ſaith, <hi>The later way, that is, of union of Churches in Claſſes, and Synods, doth more agree with the inſtitution which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was introduced by humane authoritie.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:130535:63"/>that the Inſtitution of it might be before, and the practiſe of it according to the Inſtitution come in afterwards; or if it were but inſtituted afterwards by humane authoritie, it doth not follow that it was without, much leſſe againſt authoritie divine; for he ſaith, as you cite him, <hi>it is by a divine law that the Church of Chriſt ſhould be one;</hi> if ſo, it is a dictate of naturall prudence, which is a beame of divine light, (though not an expreſſe and poſitive law of God) that all juſt and fit meanes to preſerve this union, ſo farre as the State and condition of the Church, and time will permit, be made uſe of it; and that is an union in Claſſicall, and Synodicall Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That <hi>by this later way,</hi> that is, the way of aſſociation, and ſubordination in, and to both Claſſes, and Synods, the libertie of particular <hi>Churches ſeemes to be more diminiſhed;</hi> where he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cautelouſly, ſaying, <hi>it ſeemeth</hi> to be more diminiſhed; it may ſeeme, and yet not be as it ſeemes; but if the libertie be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, the ſafetie of it by that meanes is more aſſured, and the authoritie of it the more ſtrengthened, while it governeth aright, in that if the cenſures of it be ſlighted, while they are juſt, they will be ratified by the ſuperiour Aſſembly, and the contumacy of offenders the more kept down.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That <hi>what from the beginning was Arbitrary, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was made neceſſary as a law, this law truly is Poſitive, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, and Humane, not Divine.</hi> It might be arbitrary from the beginning, while there were few Chriſtians for Churches, few Churches for union, and thoſe perhaps not ſo ſituate that they could with convenience, or ſafetie come under ſuch a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſubordination as was requiſite for the Churches ſecuritie againſt hereſie and ſchiſme; but if after the beginning (how long, or little a while is hard to know) it were thought ſo neceſſary, as to be formed up into a law, (though it were not divine but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, poſitive, and Eccleſiaſticall) and coming under no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint for impietie againſt God, or injury to man, and withall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing directly to ſuch ends as but now I noted, it is more for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Presbytery, then that which hath been alleadged for the Independency, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you and your party ſo importunately plead for.</p>
               <p>All this conſidered that you have produced in the name of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:130535:64"/>
                  <hi>Salmaſius</hi> for the Independent, and againſt the Presbyteriall way, will doe you little good, eſpecially if it be known what he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt Independency, of which, ſince you ſilently ſmother it, I will make ſome ſupply.</p>
